Schedule Maker

============

This is a schedule maker for my university classes. I decided to automate the process instead of doing it manually.

Subjects are inputted in the format of:
Programming Environment (CSE1PE) {
Lecture-([2,9,2])
Lab-([2,12,2],[2,14,2],[3,9,2],[3,11,2],[4,9,2],[4,11,2])};

Currently does not sort, only input and output of subject. This is being worked on however.

Code is not commented.

#Known Bugs
